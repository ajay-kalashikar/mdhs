<h2>Laravel</h2>

Any developer having prior experience with PHP frameworks would agree to the fact that Laravel is possibly the best PHP framework they have ever come across.

A free, open-source web framework, it is the ease-of-use that has made Laravel one of the most talked-about and widely accepted PHP frameworks today.

Gone are the days when a developer would need to go through the hassle of remembering the URL after cloning from github or downloading a zip file.

With Laravel’s latest version - Laravel 5, all you need to do is to use a Composer as your dependency manager and you can enjoy a full copy of Laravel. 

Laravel 5 is an excellent framework especially for the starters, empowering them with easy set-up of their Laravel projects. 

In addition, Laravel makes use of Artisan to expand, allowing the command line to run, thereby opening up multiple options for a variety of tasks.

One of the most significant pain points though for any developer is to maintain the sync of database between multiple development machines when developing an application. 

With Laravel migrations and seeds though, developers can heave a sigh of relief! 

Regardless of the number of changes made to the database throughout the day,with your work safely stored in Laravel migrations and seeds,
it becomes a child’s play to migrate the changes across the development machines,giving you complete control over your database. 

<h2>Heroku</h2>

Heroku is a cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages.

Rightly considered by many as a “Game Changer” in the evolving web development environment, Heroku is a powerful ‘cloud application platform’ providing higher levels of abstraction.
  
As against other popular hosting service providers like GoDaddy, Heroku comes as one of the biggest players for hosting variety of applications, serving as a dependable hosting platform for apps. 

All you need to do is to develop your app on your local machine and simply deploy the same to Heroku. 

In fact, deploying an app has never been as easy and instant as it has been with Heroku. 

This can be attributed to Heroku’s rich ecosystem of services and extensions including 3000+ ready-to-deploy buttons, 150+ third-party add-ons and over 1000 open source buildpacks. 

The growing challenges of the unparalleled web application ecosystem has generated an urgent need for instant building platforms like Heroku that can allow developers to engage customers, by staying focused on developing great apps while it takes care of the tedious hassles of 24/7 ops, upgrading & patching, failovers, security and much more. 

In fact, with Heroku’s intelligently designed architecture, companies can now aim towards precise scaling, instant deployment and wide array of tool selection by using Heroku to innovate quickly and build with modern architectures.

<h2>Travis CI</h2>

With lengthy web development and coding cycles getting replaced with instant deployments and concise procedures, it is time that we give some consideration to easy testing. 

Travis CI is one such integration platform that lets you build and successfully test GitHub hosted open source projects and code with confidence by ensuring continuous integration. 

Implementing a particular feature in any project usually involves the process of coding followed by builds and running tests after every step, to ensure the successful implementation of feature. 

Travis CI can help with easy, instant & secure deployment of this lengthy practice by automatically triggering builds and test after each integration or pull request, thereby accelerating the detection time of potential bugs. 

This can also be immensely useful especially for developers responsible for merging code base. 

One of the most highlighting things about Travis CI though is the default set of steps and build environment that it comes with, allowing easy customization of any step. 

<h2>Postgres</h2>

Considering the increased emphasis on standards-compliance and extensibility when it comes to database management, Postgres comes as a powerful object-relational database system having earned a reputation for data integrity, reliability and correctness. 

In addition to the fact that Postgres works with all major operating systems including UNIX, LINUX and Windows, the thing that makes it a dependable system is its ability to create flexible datatypes. 

In fact, creating custom columns as array of datatypes has never been as easy as it has been with Postgres. 

Given the growing need for managing excess data, the sophisticated features of Postgres including Multi-Version Concurrency Control, asynchronous replication, write ahead logging, point in time recovery, multibyte character encodings support, etc. come up as a valuable support for today’s demanding database management system. 

Indeed few of the active Postgres systems are capable of managing in excess of up to 4 terabytes of data, providing a major lead in database management.
